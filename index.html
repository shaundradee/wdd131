                        Hello, I'm Shaundra! I live in North Carolina, USA. I'm someone who finds joy in both quiet moments and creative pursuits. I grew up on a farm, which gave me a deep appreciation for nature, animals, and hard work ‚Äî values that still guide me today. I'm passionate about art and have been drawing and painting since I was young. Creativity runs through everything I do, whether it's baking something delicious, crafting a new dish in the kitchen, or designing something beautiful on a canvas. I'm a bit reserved at first, but once you know me, I'm a total goofball! I love backpacking and being outdoors, especially with my two loyal dogs ‚Äî a German Shepherd and a Doberman ‚Äî and our flock of chickens keeping things interesting at home. Most of all, I‚Äôm a wife and a mother to two amazing little girls. I hope to raise them to be kind, confident, and strong ‚Äî beautiful from the inside out. Life is busy, sometimes messy, but full of meaning, and I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.
